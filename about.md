Ahoy ! Welcome to my small space on the web.

- Currently a senior undergraduate studying Computer Science.
- This Summer (2017), I'm a summer student with [Precog Research Lab](http://precog.iiitd.edu.in/) working under [PK](http://precog.iiitd.edu.in/people/pk/Home.html).
- Last Summer (2016), I worked at [SquadRun Inc](https://squadrun.co/careers/) (Oh, and they're hiring - you can contact me.)
- I am part of the [Stanford Crowd Research Collective](http://crowdresearch.stanford.edu/w/index.php?title=Main_Page), a group of almost 1000 collaborators from around the world, led by Stanford professor [Michael Bernstein](http://hci.stanford.edu/msb/). We conduct research as a crowd, and are developing [Daemo](https://www.daemo.org/), a new crowdsourcing platform that aims to mitigate many of the shortcomings of crowdsourcing today.
